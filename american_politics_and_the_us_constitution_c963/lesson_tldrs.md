# TLDR Section 1

## Section 1 - Lesson 2

 - Society is not natural or God-given, but rather it is the product of human intention designed for the purpose of furthering a collective interest.
 - Society is defined by a social contract which is based on an understanding of what it means to be human (i.e. human nature) and of what natural rights we possess.
 - The purpose of a social contract is to enhance the potential of human nature which is done through the protection of natural rights.
 - While any form of government can be used, the optimal form of government is representative democracy (i.e. a republic).
 - Social contracts require continual renegotiation to remain relevant to present-day circumstances. This renegotiation, which can be conflictual, plays out in the democratic process. Failure to renegotiate the terms of a social contract can lead to the dissolution of society.

## Section 1 - Lesson 3

 - The influence of John Locke is front and center at the onset, with explicit mention in the Declaration of Independence. Locke, however, is replaced by Montesquieu in the Constitution, and largely in the Bill of Rights (although some of Locke's ideas pop up from time to time).
 - This transition, from Locke to Montesquieu, is a shift from natural rights to procedural rights. Natural rights are those belonging to people individually, which government may not restrict without permission. As one of the natural rights we possess is the creation of society and government, they have significant authority over the society we inhabit and the government which regulates their activity.
 - Due process, on the other hand, is a procedural right. It is not part of nature, so therefore is something people grant themselves. The task of providing this right has been given to government. As this is a right people have given themselves, it is also one they can take away. The Constitution, and most of the Bill of Rights, is built upon procedural rather than natural rights. This puts these two documents at odds with the Lockean ideas enshrined in the Declaration of Independence.
 - Interestingly, both approaches strive for liberty. The Lockean approach assumes that the liberty of being left alone is sufficient. Therefore, it should be promoted and protected. Government, then, serves us best by leaving us alone. The Montesquieu approach, however, suggests liberty to be precarious. Therefore, the task of government is to establish a frame of security within which liberty can exist. One of the threats to liberty is democracy. The amount of democracy, therefore, needs to be diminished. To offset this diminishment of democracy, government is restrained by procedural rights, which prevent it from becoming tyrannical.
 - But, there's a question here: Which set of these ideas defines the American political process? Arguably, it is Montesquieu, since his ideas underpin the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. However, the ideas of Locke are still central to American politics. His idea of liberty is not one easily relinquished. As we participate in the American political process we still see both sides play out, despite their not being easily reconciled. Conflict over these two sets of ideas, then, is an inherent part of this process.

## Section 1 - Lesson 4

 - The Articles of Confederation, in its attempt to protect the power of the states, ultimately created a national government that was too weak to function. This problem resulted in several others:
   - A unicameral congress in which states, regardless of the number of delegates and size of their population, only received one vote
   - No executive or judicial branches
   - National government left with very limited power
 - The primary goal of the Articles of Confederation was to limit the powers of the national government, thus providing for greater state sovereignty.
 - The structure of the national government under the Articles of Confederation did not mirror our current structure of government, demonstrating the need for multiple branches of government.
 - The Articles of Confederation limited the powers of the national government too much, ultimately making it too weak to function.

## Section 1 - Lesson 5

 - At its foundation, the major problem with the Articles of Confederation was that, in the effort to limit the possibility of tyranny by the national government, the national government was not given enough power to effectively function.
 - Because the national government was limited under what it could do under the Articles of Confederation, the United States had a weak economy and an international reputation of being weak among other countries.
 - In order for the United States to survive, the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation had to be addressed with the Constitutional Convention.

## Section 1 - Lesson 7

 - The Virginia Plan called for a bicameral legislature consisting of two chambers with representation based on population.
 - The New Jersey Plan opposed the Virginia Plan because smaller states feared their interests would be pushed aside by the more populous states.
 - The New Jersey Plan called for a unicameral legislature in which states would have the same representation regardless of population.
 - The Virginia and New Jersey Plans differed in their ideas of power that should belong to the national and state governments.

## Section 1 - Lession 8

 - The Great Compromise satisfied the concerns over proper representation in the legislature by creating a bicameral legislature.
 - The Three-Fifths Compromise satisfied the concerns of the South over the counting of their slave population by allowing 60% of the slave population to be counted for state representation and tax purposes.
 - Separation of powers and checks and balances satisfied the concerns of those who feared the central government having too much power.

## Section 1 - Lesson 8

- In a real sense, the Federalists and Anti-Federalists could be viewed as our first two major political parties.
- Although the Federalists appeared to win over the states and get the Constitution ratified with significantly more powers given to the national government, it was not without some concessions given to the Anti-Federalists. This mainly included the addition of the Bill of Rights to the Constitution in 1791.

## Section 1 - Lession 10

 - The Federalists and Anti-Federalists had competing views for how power should be structured between the national government and the states.
 - The Federalists used the publication of The Federalist Papers to ease the fears of those who were not confident with the increased powers of the national government under the Constitution.
 - Federalist, no. 10 eased the fear of the power of factions and encouraged the citizens to promote liberty of opinions and ideas.
 - Federalist, no. 51 eased the fear of the national government abusing its power with promotion of both separation of powers and checks and balances.

## Section 1 - Lesson 10

 - The separation of powers was designed to avoid the possibility of a tyrannical government that would ignore the rights of its citizens.
 - Each of the three branches of government checks the other two and is, in turn, checked by the other two.
 - The president has great power as commander-in-chief and chief diplomat.
 - Congress passes legislation and must approve presidential nominations.
 - Judicial review is the key power for the courts as a separate branch of government.

## Section 1 - Lesson 14

 - Federalism as an effective system of government has generally worked in the United States for the most part, but any system of government has both positive and negative effects.
 - The Civil War demonstrated that the system was imperfect since it failed to prevent the outbreak of that bloody conflict.
 - Federalism has permitted diverse groups to be represented, even if imperfectly, and provided for local preferences to be present in the creation of government programs.
 - Like any system, there are tradeoffs between citizens receiving uniform treatment and local variations to take into account local circumstances. There are costs in terms of inefficiencies and the lack of uniform treatment of citizens where that might be desirable.
 - The American system of federalism combined with checks and balances means that it is sometimes difficult for the government to act. The inclusion of both federalism and checks and balances in the Constitution, which are separate arrangements and which need not go together, was designed to make it more difficult for the national government to act.
 - While both levels of government have reserved powers and share concurrent powers, the balance between the national government and the state governments have changed over time. While both do more today than in the past, the national government has become relatively more important as the United States has become more involved in the world and as that world has become more complex.

**Advantages of Federalism**

There are a number of potential advantages for federalism:

 - One of the most obvious advantages is the ability of individual states to innovate in the ways that they deal with problems. When one state finds a solution that works better than others, other states will adopt the solution. The national government has even copied parts of state laws when creating a national version.
 - In many ways, states are better able to adapt to local conditions and design programs that work best for their citizens. New York, Texas, and California need legislation to deal with urban issues, while North Dakota and Vermont do not. Farming states need much more agricultural legislation than those with other dominant economic activities.
 - A third advantage for federalism is that the national government can pass a basic program that will cover the country (such as disability payments for those injured on the job), and states can add to the program if they decide to do so.
 - A fourth potential advantage is at the heart of federalism in that power is divided so that it is more difficult for any group or groups to take over control of the government and violate the rights of citizens or some groups of citizens. There is protection against oppression with divided power.
 - Finally, federalism at least provides the opportunity for individuals to participate more in the political system. An individual citizen can interact with both state elected officials and national officials. Elected politicians and other officials at the state level are often easier to contract in part because they are closer to the citizens of the state.

**Disadvantages of Federalism**

Federalism, as a form of government, also has some potential disadvantages. This explains why some countries prefer an alternate form of government.

 - There is no doubt that federalism can be inefficient since it requires coordination and cooperation between the national government and the state governments. Even when the governments are willing to cooperate, there will be costs involved. However, when one or the other is unwilling, the inefficiencies increase.
 - There can also be difficulties when actions in one state cause problems in neighboring states (as could happen if a river is polluted upstream). Voters are less willing to pay to avoid problems when the negative consequences occur in another state.
 - Inefficiency appears in another way. All 50 states have to have a department of education, a transportation department, a bureau to administer Medicaid and unemployment benefits, and a host of other jobs. This duplication of effort can be costly, especially in the smaller states. Unitary states can use regional offices for some of these programs.
 - Finally, in a federal system, not all U.S. citizens are treated the same. Some have access to better educational facilities. College tuition can be cheaper. Others have better highway systems or more public medical care. In addition, richer states can afford to provide more services to their citizens than poorer states. Since not everyone can move to another state, the inequalities among systems will persist.
