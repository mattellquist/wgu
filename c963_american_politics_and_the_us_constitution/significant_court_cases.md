 - **Marbury v. Madison**: This case involved the Judiciary Act of 1789. The Supreme Court declared that the law conflicted with the U.S. Constitution, and the case established the principle of judicial review wherein the Supreme Court has the power to declare laws passed by Congress and signed by the president to be unconstitutional.

 - **McCulloch v. Maryland**: This case centered on Congress and the creation of the 2nd Bank of the United States. The Supreme Court confirmed that Congress had the authority to establish the Bank with a broad interpretation of Congressional power implied in the ‘necessary and proper clause’ as part of its enumerated power to tax and raise money (Constitution, Art.1, Sec. 8). In addition, the Court case reaffirmed the supremacy clause (Constitution, Art. 4) that places federal over state power and the idea that states cannot tax the federal government.

 - **Gibbons v. Ogden**: Commerce Clause

  Is a court case that clarified the power of the federal government over states with the Constitution’s commerce clause that gave Congress the power to regulate commerce that crosses state lines (that is, interstate economic activity)

 - **Barron v. Baltimore**: This case involved a local business owner who sued the city government with the claim that city construction efforts had taken away land essential to his business without being compensated for his loss (a violation of the 5th amendment ‘eminent domain’ protections).

 - **Gillette v. United States**: The Supreme Court ruled against the petitioners and asserted both that the law did not violate the 1st amendment and that, to qualify as a conscientious objector (per the MSA), a person must be opposed to serving in any war, not just a particular conflict.

 - **Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.**: The Supreme Court determined that the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act gave protection not only to private businesses, but also to closely held corporations often run by a family or small group of investors, allowing Hobby Lobby Stores, a national crafts store, to claim a religious exemption to the contraception provisions in the PPACA.

 - **Lemon v. Kurtzman**: Lemon v. Kurtzman ruled against the State of Pennsylvania, determining that monitoring the classroom instruction of Catholic school teachers paid with public funds to ensure those funds were not being used for religious education would require ‘excessive entanglement’ between church and state.

 - **Sherbert v. Verner**: The Supreme Court required that state unemployment laws must be narrowly tailored to the need to promote employment and must provide reasonable accommodations for religious ‘free exercise’ exemptions from the employment requirement.

 - **Branzburg v. Hayes**: The Supreme Court rejected the Louisville Courier Journal reporter’s argument, stating that the government had a “compelling and paramount state interest” in requiring media reporters to disclose confidential information when investigating a potential criminal activity.

 - **Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission**: Prior to the Citizens United v. FEC case, only private individuals were legally permitted to contribute to political candidates, political parties, and Political Action Committees (PACs). With this case, the Supreme Court ruled that corporations, labor unions, and associations enjoyed 1st amendment freedom of speech protection to directly spend money creating political content, provided that their actions remained 100% independent from any political candidate campaign. This case opened the door for widespread corporate, labor union, and professional association funding of ‘independent expenditure-only PACS’, commonly called Super-PACs. 

 - **New York Times Co. v. United States**: The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the New York Times company, stating that the 1st amendment freedom of the press protections limited government’s ability to censor the press and that the prior restraint standard only applied if the public release of information would cause “inevitable, direct and immediate harm” to national security.

 - **Miller v. California**: The Supreme Court ruled that obscene materials do not enjoy 1st amendment protection. Further, the court established a set of three questions known as the Miller Test to help guide future courts’ efforts to determine the right balance between free speech v. the regulation of obscene content.

 - **Buckley v. Valeo**: The Supreme Court answered two questions in this case. First, the court ruled that individuals did have a protected 1st amendment right to contribute money to political campaigns, but that monetary limits on the amount of such individual campaign contributions did NOT violate the First Amendment. Second, the Court ruled that total campaign spending limits and limits on a candidate’s use of their own money DO violate the First Amendment.

 - **Texas v. Johnson**: The Supreme Court ruled that Texas’ venerated objects law that prevented flag burning did not trump the 1st amendment freedom of speech right to display one’s anger by desecrating that symbol of the U.S. The decision focused on flag burning as a form of ‘symbolic speech’ and noted that the Texas effectively was attempting to punish ‘a point of view,’ not the physical act of burning the flag.

 - **Brandenburg v. Ohio**: The Supreme Court ruled that only speech or writing that constituted a direct plan or call for imminent lawless action or an illegal act in the immediate future could be suppressed. The mere advocacy of a hypothetical revolution was protected under the 1st amendment freedom of speech.

 - **West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette**: The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Barnette family whose members were threatened with legal sanctions after their children refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance and other nationalist rituals in the public school (the Jehovah’s Witness faith prohibits pledging oaths to non-religious symbols). The Supreme Court stated that the government policy violated 1st amendment Free Speech protection (the desire for national unity could not be enforced by punishing dissent from that view for either religious or non-religious reasons).

 - **Cohen v. California**: The Supreme Court overturned the conviction and established that the 1st amendment freedom of speech protected the provocative expression of emotions and ideas in print since there was no evidence that the words incited a substantial number of people to physical action nor violence.

 - **Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District**: The Supreme Court ruled in this case the suspensions violated the 1st amendment freedom of speech liberties of the students and the symbolic form of political speech that this protest represented. While courts often defer to schools in free speech cases (recognizing the important social function of schools in providing public education), in this case the court determined that student speech is protected as long as the actions are not disrupting that fundamental educational function.

 - **Dred Scott v. Sandford**: The Dred Scott v. Sandford case arose due to the 1820 Missouri Compromise, a pre-Civil War pair of federal laws that admitted Missouri to the union as a slave state in exchange for a law that prohibited further creation of slave states north of the 36.5 N latitude line. The case stemmed from the question of freedom for Mr. Dred Scott.

 - **U.S. v. Miller**: During this period, the Supreme Court put significant emphasis on the “well-organized militia” language to uphold the 1934 National Firearms Act’s prohibition of sawed-off shotguns. The court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of that law with an argument that possession of such a modified shotgun was not related to the legitimate state interest in promoting a “well-regulated militia” for the defense of the state. Therefore, federal and state laws could regulate and prohibit weapons that did not serve that purpose.

 - **McDonald v. Chicago**: The McDonald v. Chicago case affirmed that the precedent set with District of Columbia v. Heller carried over to all government at all levels (including the City of Chicago, IL) under the 2nd amendment and the 14th amendment due process clause. These two cases solidified a Supreme Court shift towards “individual right to self-defense” interpretations of the 2nd amendment as a fundamental liberty that extended throughout the country.

 - **District of Columbia v. Heller**: In a 5-4 majority decision, the Court ruled that the original intent of the 2nd amendment extended beyond the formation of a government-sponsored militia and assumed a general right for all adult people to have a commonly used weapon like a handgun actively assembled in the home for self-defense.

 - **Furman v. Georgia**: The case stemmed from Mr. Furman, who was caught burglarizing a private home by the homeowner. As Mr. Furman fled the scene, he tripped, causing the gun to accidently fire and kill the homeowner. Furman was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The court ruled that the death penalty did constitute “cruel and unusual punishment” in the absence of an intent to commit murder. Decided alongside two similar cases involving homicide during the commission over other crimes, Furman v. Georgia forced U.S. states to rethink many laws regarding capital punishment to ensure the law was not being administered in a discriminatory manner towards racial and ethnic minorities or in an otherwise arbitrary, capricious manner.

 - **Miranda v. Arizona**: This case gave rise to the popular Miranda warning issued by law enforcement (usually detectives interrogating the witness), as made popular in TV crime dramas. The case stemmed from an Arizona man who was arrested, interrogated, and confessed to kidnapping and sexual assault without first being informed of his Fifth Amendment right not to self-incriminate. His appeal to the Supreme Court upon being found guilty resulted in a decision that the right to not incriminate oneself relies heavily a suspect being informed of these rights at the time of arrest. This ensures that any statements they provide are voluntary.

 - **Gideon v. Wainwright**: The court case extended this civil rights protection to defendants in state courts (federal courts already had a public defender program). The case stemmed from the arrest of a man who was accused of breaking into a poolroom and stealing money from a cigarette machine. Not being able to afford a lawyer, and being denied a public defender by the judge, the man defended himself and was subsequently found guilty. The key principle here is that justice is not equally applied if only those with wealth have professional legal representation.

 - **Mapp v. Ohio**: The Supreme Court ruled that evidence obtained by the government without a warrant (with some exceptions) could not be used as evidence in a state criminal trial. This case led to broad application of the exclusionary rule, a concept first established in federal courts in the 1914 Weeks v. United States court case.

 - **Planned Parenthood v. Casey**: Upheld Roe v. Wade (14th amendment) 

 With this Court ruling, the Supreme Court upheld the fundamental principle of Roe v. Wade (1973) that women have a Constitutionally protected 14th amendment due process right to seek or obtain an abortion prior to fetal viability and that government laws creating an “undue burden” on that ability were not constitutional.

 - **Roe v. Wade**: Abortion Rights

 The Supreme Court case centered on the question of whether there is a constitutional right to privacy implied in either the 1st, 4th, 5th, 9th, or 14th amendments and whether that right to privacy extended to a woman’s right to determine her own reproductive choices with her own body. The court ultimately determined that the right to privacy does exist and that such privacy extends to the question of abortion.

 - **Griswold v. Connecticut**: Marital Privacy (1st, 3rd, 9th, and 14th amendments)
 
 The Griswold v. Connecticut case is an important moment in the effort to define a broad right to privacy and a sphere of activity free from unwarranted government involvement in our lives.

 - **Obergefell v. Hodges**: Legalized same-sex marriage (14th ammendment)

 The 5-4 majority court opinion asserted that the denial of same-sex marriage rights was a violation of both equal protection and due process with the unfair denial of a fundamental liberty and also invoked the 14th amendment privileges and immunities clause to rule that a marriage license issued in one state had to be recognized in other states.

 - **Korematsu v. U.S.**: Deprivation of Liberty

 During World War II, citizens of Japanese descent living on the West Coast, whether naturalized immigrants or Japanese Americans born in the United States, were subjected to the indignity of being removed from their communities and interned under Executive Order 9066. When challenged, the Supreme Court decision in this case upheld the actions of the government as a necessary precaution in a time of war.

 - **Miller v. Johnson**: Racial Gerrymandering

 The Supreme Court ruled that Georgia’s congressional House districts DID violate the 14th amendment Equal Protection clause since the odd, non-compact district boundaries undermined the concept of “ONE PERSON, ONE VOTE” by giving some voters more influence than others in an intentional way. The court set a general standard that NON-COMPACTNESS is a clear sign of racial segregation built into a single district.

 - **Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka**: Challenged Separate but Equal (14th ammendment)

 The Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka case stemmed from K-12 public school students in Topeka, Kansas and several other districts who were denied admittance to certain public schools due exclusively to their race. The unanimous decision in this case determined that the existence of racially segregated public schools violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren famously stated, “separate is inherently unequal.”

 - **Plessy v. Ferguson**: Separate but Equal

 The case centered on a man of mixed racial heritage who sat in a whites-only railroad car in an attempt to challenge a Louisiana law that required railroad cars be segregated. The man was arrested and convicted for violation of Louisiana’s racial segregation laws. The court refused his appeal that the law was in a violation of the 14th amendment’s Equal Protection clause. The court maintained that the requirement to have racially segregated train cars still provided a “separate but equal” opportunity to ride in a train car for both white and African American residents.
