# TLDR Section 1

## Section 1 - Lesson 2

 - Society is not natural or God-given, but rather it is the product of human intention designed for the purpose of furthering a collective interest.
 - Society is defined by a social contract which is based on an understanding of what it means to be human (i.e. human nature) and of what natural rights we possess.
 - The purpose of a social contract is to enhance the potential of human nature which is done through the protection of natural rights.
 - While any form of government can be used, the optimal form of government is representative democracy (i.e. a republic).
 - Social contracts require continual renegotiation to remain relevant to present-day circumstances. This renegotiation, which can be conflictual, plays out in the democratic process. Failure to renegotiate the terms of a social contract can lead to the dissolution of society.

## Section 1 - Lesson 3

 - The influence of John Locke is front and center at the onset, with explicit mention in the Declaration of Independence. Locke, however, is replaced by Montesquieu in the Constitution, and largely in the Bill of Rights (although some of Locke's ideas pop up from time to time).
 - This transition, from Locke to Montesquieu, is a shift from natural rights to procedural rights. Natural rights are those belonging to people individually, which government may not restrict without permission. As one of the natural rights we possess is the creation of society and government, they have significant authority over the society we inhabit and the government which regulates their activity.
 - Due process, on the other hand, is a procedural right. It is not part of nature, so therefore is something people grant themselves. The task of providing this right has been given to government. As this is a right people have given themselves, it is also one they can take away. The Constitution, and most of the Bill of Rights, is built upon procedural rather than natural rights. This puts these two documents at odds with the Lockean ideas enshrined in the Declaration of Independence.
 - Interestingly, both approaches strive for liberty. The Lockean approach assumes that the liberty of being left alone is sufficient. Therefore, it should be promoted and protected. Government, then, serves us best by leaving us alone. The Montesquieu approach, however, suggests liberty to be precarious. Therefore, the task of government is to establish a frame of security within which liberty can exist. One of the threats to liberty is democracy. The amount of democracy, therefore, needs to be diminished. To offset this diminishment of democracy, government is restrained by procedural rights, which prevent it from becoming tyrannical.
 - But, there's a question here: Which set of these ideas defines the American political process? Arguably, it is Montesquieu, since his ideas underpin the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. However, the ideas of Locke are still central to American politics. His idea of liberty is not one easily relinquished. As we participate in the American political process we still see both sides play out, despite their not being easily reconciled. Conflict over these two sets of ideas, then, is an inherent part of this process.

## Section 1 - Lesson 4

 - The Articles of Confederation, in its attempt to protect the power of the states, ultimately created a national government that was too weak to function. This problem resulted in several others:
   - A unicameral congress in which states, regardless of the number of delegates and size of their population, only received one vote
   - No executive or judicial branches
   - National government left with very limited power
 - The primary goal of the Articles of Confederation was to limit the powers of the national government, thus providing for greater state sovereignty.
 - The structure of the national government under the Articles of Confederation did not mirror our current structure of government, demonstrating the need for multiple branches of government.
 - The Articles of Confederation limited the powers of the national government too much, ultimately making it too weak to function.

## Section 1 - Lesson 5

 - At its foundation, the major problem with the Articles of Confederation was that, in the effort to limit the possibility of tyranny by the national government, the national government was not given enough power to effectively function.
 - Because the national government was limited under what it could do under the Articles of Confederation, the United States had a weak economy and an international reputation of being weak among other countries.
 - In order for the United States to survive, the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation had to be addressed with the Constitutional Convention.

## Section 1 - Lesson 7

 - The Virginia Plan called for a bicameral legislature consisting of two chambers with representation based on population.
 - The New Jersey Plan opposed the Virginia Plan because smaller states feared their interests would be pushed aside by the more populous states.
 - The New Jersey Plan called for a unicameral legislature in which states would have the same representation regardless of population.
 - The Virginia and New Jersey Plans differed in their ideas of power that should belong to the national and state governments.

## Section 1 - Lession 8

 - The Great Compromise satisfied the concerns over proper representation in the legislature by creating a bicameral legislature.
 - The Three-Fifths Compromise satisfied the concerns of the South over the counting of their slave population by allowing 60% of the slave population to be counted for state representation and tax purposes.
 - Separation of powers and checks and balances satisfied the concerns of those who feared the central government having too much power.

## Section 1 - Lesson 8

- In a real sense, the Federalists and Anti-Federalists could be viewed as our first two major political parties.
- Although the Federalists appeared to win over the states and get the Constitution ratified with significantly more powers given to the national government, it was not without some concessions given to the Anti-Federalists. This mainly included the addition of the Bill of Rights to the Constitution in 1791.

## Section 1 - Lession 10

 - The Federalists and Anti-Federalists had competing views for how power should be structured between the national government and the states.
 - The Federalists used the publication of The Federalist Papers to ease the fears of those who were not confident with the increased powers of the national government under the Constitution.
 - Federalist, no. 10 eased the fear of the power of factions and encouraged the citizens to promote liberty of opinions and ideas.
 - Federalist, no. 51 eased the fear of the national government abusing its power with promotion of both separation of powers and checks and balances.

## Section 1 - Lesson 10

 - The separation of powers was designed to avoid the possibility of a tyrannical government that would ignore the rights of its citizens.
 - Each of the three branches of government checks the other two and is, in turn, checked by the other two.
 - The president has great power as commander-in-chief and chief diplomat.
 - Congress passes legislation and must approve presidential nominations.
 - Judicial review is the key power for the courts as a separate branch of government.

## Section 1 - Lesson 13

## Section 1 - Lesson 14

 - Federalism as an effective system of government has generally worked in the United States for the most part, but any system of government has both positive and negative effects.
 - The Civil War demonstrated that the system was imperfect since it failed to prevent the outbreak of that bloody conflict.
 - Federalism has permitted diverse groups to be represented, even if imperfectly, and provided for local preferences to be present in the creation of government programs.
 - Like any system, there are tradeoffs between citizens receiving uniform treatment and local variations to take into account local circumstances. There are costs in terms of inefficiencies and the lack of uniform treatment of citizens where that might be desirable.
 - The American system of federalism combined with checks and balances means that it is sometimes difficult for the government to act. The inclusion of both federalism and checks and balances in the Constitution, which are separate arrangements and which need not go together, was designed to make it more difficult for the national government to act.
 - While both levels of government have reserved powers and share concurrent powers, the balance between the national government and the state governments have changed over time. While both do more today than in the past, the national government has become relatively more important as the United States has become more involved in the world and as that world has become more complex.

**Advantages of Federalism**

There are a number of potential advantages for federalism:

 - One of the most obvious advantages is the ability of individual states to innovate in the ways that they deal with problems. When one state finds a solution that works better than others, other states will adopt the solution. The national government has even copied parts of state laws when creating a national version.
 - In many ways, states are better able to adapt to local conditions and design programs that work best for their citizens. New York, Texas, and California need legislation to deal with urban issues, while North Dakota and Vermont do not. Farming states need much more agricultural legislation than those with other dominant economic activities.
 - A third advantage for federalism is that the national government can pass a basic program that will cover the country (such as disability payments for those injured on the job), and states can add to the program if they decide to do so.
 - A fourth potential advantage is at the heart of federalism in that power is divided so that it is more difficult for any group or groups to take over control of the government and violate the rights of citizens or some groups of citizens. There is protection against oppression with divided power.
 - Finally, federalism at least provides the opportunity for individuals to participate more in the political system. An individual citizen can interact with both state elected officials and national officials. Elected politicians and other officials at the state level are often easier to contract in part because they are closer to the citizens of the state.

**Disadvantages of Federalism**

Federalism, as a form of government, also has some potential disadvantages. This explains why some countries prefer an alternate form of government.

 - There is no doubt that federalism can be inefficient since it requires coordination and cooperation between the national government and the state governments. Even when the governments are willing to cooperate, there will be costs involved. However, when one or the other is unwilling, the inefficiencies increase.
 - There can also be difficulties when actions in one state cause problems in neighboring states (as could happen if a river is polluted upstream). Voters are less willing to pay to avoid problems when the negative consequences occur in another state.
 - Inefficiency appears in another way. All 50 states have to have a department of education, a transportation department, a bureau to administer Medicaid and unemployment benefits, and a host of other jobs. This duplication of effort can be costly, especially in the smaller states. Unitary states can use regional offices for some of these programs.
 - Finally, in a federal system, not all U.S. citizens are treated the same. Some have access to better educational facilities. College tuition can be cheaper. Others have better highway systems or more public medical care. In addition, richer states can afford to provide more services to their citizens than poorer states. Since not everyone can move to another state, the inequalities among systems will persist.

# TLDR Section 2

## Section 2 - Lesson 1

Seven Congressional Powers:

 - Tax citizens
 - Set the budget
 - Regulate commerce
 - Declare war
 - Provide advice and consent on appointments
 - Impeach individuals
 - Oversee the powers of the judicial and executive branches

## Section 2 - Lesson 2

  -The legislative process is a lengthy and cumbersome one, and deliberately so.
  -In an effort to maintain balance among the different branches of government, the Constitution placed checks on Congress’s ability to pass laws.
  -In addition, Congress has added additional layers to the process through the use of the committee system. Recall that there are four types of committees that each serve various functions:
    - Standing Committees are permanent committees that address timeless, recurring issues.
    - Select Committees are temporary committees set up to address or investigate an issue not covered by one of the standing committees.
    - Joint Committees have members from both houses of Congress serving on one committee together.
    - Conference Committees have members from both houses of Congress and reconcile different versions of the same bill that has passed both houses to form a single unified bill that goes to the president.

### The Process of Lawmaking
In addition to the committee system, the process of lawmaking has several parts as well. Remember the process reviewed in the lesson:

1. The bill is introduced and given to the appropriate standing committee.
2. The bill is sent to the Rules Committee.
3. The bill is debated in the House of Representatives and Senate with the possibility of a filibuster in the Senate.
4. The bill is voted upon by the House of Representatives and the Senate.
5. The bill is sent to the conference committee to form one unified bill.
6. The unified bill is sent back to the House of Representatives and Senate to be voted upon.
7. The bill goes to the president for signature or veto. If vetoed, Congress has the ability to override the veto.

The Constitutional requirement that there be an actual enumeration of people every ten years has led to several political and constitutional problems, beginning at the Constitutional Convention itself and continuing to the present day. Since each state’s number of representatives depends on the census, and since redistricting can be—and has been—manipulated to secure politically unfavorable outcomes for political parties or ethnic and racial minorities, the processes of the census, reapportionment, and redistricting, can be potent political tools.

Take a moment to consider the main points of this lesson:

 - Every state must go through the process of reapportionment and redistricting every 10 years to accommodate for changes in their state’s population based on the last census.
 - State legislatures are responsible for drawing electoral districts, which makes districts more susceptible to gerrymandering.
 - Gerrymandering is the re-drawing of electoral districts to give an advantage or disadvantage to either a particular political party or group. In general, gerrymandering is not illegal but has been ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court when race is the basis for gerrymandering.
 - While the courts have considered many cases concerning racial gerrymandering, they are just beginning to consider cases concerning partisan gerrymandering.

 ## Section 2 - Lesson 4

 - The delegates at the Constitutional Convention proposed creating the office of the president and debated many forms the role might take. The president is now elected for a maximum of two, four-year terms and can be impeached by Congress for wrongdoing and subsequently removed from office. The presidency and presidential power, especially war powers, have expanded greatly over the last two centuries, often with the willing assistance of the legislative branch.
 - Executive privilege has been used by presidents to withhold information from Congress to both avoid the congressional usurping of presidential power and to protect individuals from embarrassing actions.
 - Executive orders can be used to achieve presidential objectives.
 - Presidents have become responsible for preparing the budget that is sent to Congress.
 - Presidents have the power to veto legislation.
 - Presidential activities are covered more intensively with the availability of modern media.
 - The president is commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
As the national government has become responsible for more activities, the president as head of the executive branch has become even more important.

## Section 2 - Lesson 5

 - The power of any president is limited by the system of checks and balances, but any president will have great power in a number of areas.
 - The power of the pardon is virtually unchecked for federal crimes.
 - The power of commander-in-chief provide him with great freedom of action and potential in the area of foreign policy.
 - Presidents can issue executive orders in their capacity as head of the bureaucracy with limited oversight by Congress or the courts.
 - Presidents can negotiate executive agreements with foreign leaders that do not require senatorial approval.
 - Presidents have the opportunity to nominate individuals to cabinet-level positions, especially to the Supreme Court, and this can be extremely important.
 - Presidents are in a unique position to attempt to persuade public opinion and Congress to support their policies. They are sometimes successful and sometimes not, but they have the opportunity to make the attempt.

## Ssection 2 - Lesson 6

 - New presidents face a number of important challenges. They have to make the transition from being a candidate to being an elected official in a democratic system. They have to learn the powers of the office and work in a complex government system. They need to recognize the limitations inherent in the system of checks and balances.
 - New presidents need to be prepared for a smooth transition from their predecessor. They need to quickly nominate individuals for many government positions including the Cabinet and the ambassadors. They need to formulate and present a political agenda for the future. They will have to perform all the ongoing functions of the presidency.

## Section 2 - Lesson 7

 - The judicial branch was no doubt perceived to be the weakest branch of the new government. Over the course of time, however, the courts have become more involved in the process of governing the country. 
 - Marbury v. Madison clearly set the pattern of judicial review. 
 - The passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, extending the coverage of the Bills of Rights to the states with the accompanying limitations, resulted in additional cases for the courts. 
 - Some changes have resulted from the demands of ongoing modernization that changes the nature of political activity. The world is changing in other ways that have brought up issues that end up in front of the courts because of their complexity and the need to adjust past laws, rules, and regulations to new situations. 
 - Finally, there are more laws that have passed Congress, more actions from the president or the bureaucracy, and more actions by the states that can require decisions in the judicial system. Some of these decisions, even those that are made by judges or Justices adhering to a doctrine of judicial restraint, will inevitably involve some element of policy-making.

## Section 2 - Lesson 8

 - The founding fathers decided to create a complete system of courts for the new country. The federal judiciary consists of District Courts, Circuit Courts of Appeals, and the Supreme Court. District Courts deal with questions of guilt or innocence in criminal cases and who is responsible in civil cases. 
 - Cases will work their way up the system to either a circuit court of appeals or, in a few cases, the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court remains the major decision-making body for interpretations of the Constitution and evaluations of the actions of the other branches of the government. 
 - The system provides a means for interpretations of the Constitution to be determined. 
 - The importance of cases that come before the circuit courts and the Supreme Court is evidenced by the fact that parties not directly affected by the case become involved. They submit written documents (amicus curiae briefs—"friend of the court" briefs) in support of one side or the other in hopes of getting a decision that is in keeping with preferences on the broader constitutional issues being considered.

## Section 2 - Lesson 9

The U.S. courts pride themselves on two achievements:
 - As part of the framers’ system of checks and balances, they protect the sanctity of the U.S. Constitution from breaches by the other branches of government.
 - They protect individual rights against societal and governmental oppression. 
 - The Constitution remains the key document for the government, and it is the supreme law of the land. The federal courts have a key role in determining which actions of government at all levels are permissible and which ones are not permissible because they violate the Constitution or infringe upon the rights of U.S. citizens. The protection of these rights is an essential part of a democratic system.

## Section 2 - Lesson 11

 - These two important Supreme Court cases illustrated how the Supreme Court expanded the power of the national government through the Necessary and Proper Clause’s implication of expanded powers, the Supremacy Clause, and the expressed power of Congress to regulate commerce.
 - Although language existed in the Constitution that increased the powers of the national government over the states, the Supreme Court found itself in the contentious debate between the national government and the states, ultimately using the Constitution to increase the powers of the national government.
